# ---- Installation ----

* To install this package, you need intel fortran compiler (ifort) and f2py.
* To use other fortran compiler, please edit F90/src/Makefile but other fortran compiler is not tested.

* Please type the following command in the current directory:
    ./MAKEFILE all

* In the installation, 
  1) first fortran 90 sources under F90/src/*.f90 are compiled, creating fortran module and library under F90/mod and F90/lib. 
  2) then interface to python under bispec/*.f90 is compiled by f2py, creating python module under wrap/

# ---- Usage ----

* Example of how to use this package: example/code_check.ipynb
* Please convert it to ***.py using ipython if you need to run python code in the command line. 

# ---- Other ----

* Code is tested at the NERSC environment (https://www.nersc.gov/)

* To compute the bispectrum, a precomputed matter power spectrum P(k) at z=0 is required. 
* The data of P(k) is saved in data/Pklin.dat using the cosmology adopted to the fullsky lensing simulation of Takahashi et al.
